# calculator
This project is for The Odin Project. It's a calculator. Currently, it can only calculate using two numbers and a single operator, but that may change. DOM manipulation is annoying.
# DISCLAIMER:
You have to hit the clear button every time you want to do a new calculation, because I got the minimum amount of code to work and I don't want to have to change it now..
